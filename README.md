# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – My Second ML Project

This is my **second machine learning project**, part of my personal journey into the world of ML. After successfully completing the Titanic survival prediction project, I wanted to try a multi-class classification problem — and the **Iris flower dataset** was the perfect next step! 🌱

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Harini 👋  
I'm learning machine learning through a **project-based approach**, starting from the basics and growing step by step. This project is a milestone in my journey as I move beyond binary classification and explore multi-class problems.

---

## 📚 Dataset

I used the classic **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

**Target**:  
Predict the **species** of the flower:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

---

## 🔍 What I Did

- Explored the dataset using Seaborn plots like `pairplot`
- Visualized class distributions
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

---

## 📈 Accuracy

The model achieved **over 90% accuracy** on the test set, and the confusion matrix showed very few misclassifications. 🚀

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Understanding how **logistic regression** can be used for multi-class problems
- Importance of **feature visualization** using pairplots
- How to evaluate classifiers using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
- How to build an end-to-end ML pipeline

---

## 🔜 What’s Next?

🔄 I plan to:
- Try other classifiers on this dataset like **KNN** and **Decision Trees**
- Compare performance across models
- Build more hands-on projects to solidify my skills
